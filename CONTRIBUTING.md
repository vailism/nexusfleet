## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to check our [Issues](../../issues) to see if someone else in the community has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and [make one](../../issues/new).

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork NexusFleet ERP and create a branch with a descriptive name.

## Get the test suite running

Make sure your local environment is set up according to the Installation instructions in the README. Ensure your code lints and passes type-checking before submitting a PR.

```bash
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
